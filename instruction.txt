Start a new season. Then you can
enter your grade and credit for 
your subject in Grade and Credit blanks.
The Subject blank is optional, you can use it
for clarification, maybe. After you finish entering
1 subject, press Submit. The program will take your 
data if your inputs make sense. After you've done 
entering everything, press Done. The program will 
then take you to the result screen. Simple!
